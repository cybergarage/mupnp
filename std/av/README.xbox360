Requirements for Microsoft XBox 360 UPNP Support.


*
UPNP Friendly Name (cg_upnpav_dms_setfriendlyname) must be of the form:
   XXXX (MediaServer) : 1

For example, "mUPnP for C Media Server (MediaServer) : 1"

*
The ModelName (cg_upnp_device_setmodelname) must be one of:

    * Windows Media Connect
    * Windows Media Player

*
Device must have service X_MS_MediaReceiverRegistrar and 3 methods.

X_MS_MediaReceiverRegistrar Service

This service is required to a certain extent. It must be listed,
however all requests to the service can be safely denied and the
description can be empty or even blank. The XBox will periodically
make queries to the non-existent service, but never actually complain
about it not working. If the service is not present in the device
description, the device will still show up, however upon connection,
it will timeout and complain about network connectivity problems, or
something equally generic.

NOTE:
Please be aware that the Syabas Networked Media Tank OEM players
(Popcornhour, HDX etc) enter a special UPNP mode if the ModelName is
set to "Windows Media Connect" or "Windows Media Player".

This special (4-icon mode) makes some hard-coded assumptions, like
that of; ROOT "0" will contain "Videos" with ID="2". This means you
will have to chose between supporting Syabas' NMT players, or
Microsoft XBox 360. Supporting both will be tricky.

One option could be to handle requests and change ModelName in your 
http_listener:

        server = cg_http_request_getheadervalue(httpReq, "SERVER");
        if (server && strcasestr(server,
                       "xbox")) {
            cg_upnp_device_setmodelname(dev, "Windows Media Connect");
        } else {
            cg_upnp_device_setmodelname(dev, "CyberGarage Media Server");
        }

        cg_upnp_device_httprequestrecieved(httpReq);


Alternatively, if you wish to use "Windows Media Connect" with NMT, you need
to handle (hard-coded) ID=2, ID=3 etc.
